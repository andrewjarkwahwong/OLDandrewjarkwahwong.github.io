However, determining simulations for electrocatalysis is challenging. In particular, we will introduce and address the main two concerns: 1) implementation of a Potentiostat and 2) incorporation of the electrode-electrolyte interface.</p> <h2 id="the-dilemma-constant-charge-to-constant-potential">The Dilemma: Constant Charge to Constant Potential</h2> <p>DFT simulations can be seen as a “snapshot” of different ground-energy states along a reaction path. Consider a simple reaction of \(Na^+_{(g)}\) adsorbing onto a metal surface. This reaction can be written as:</p> \[Na^+_{(g)} + * \rightarrow Na* + e^-\] <p>where the free energy change as a function of the applied potential on an absolute scale, \(U_{abs}\) can be defined as:</p> \[\Delta G_{ads}=G_{e^-}+G_{Na*}-G_{*}-G_{Na^+}\] \[\Delta G_{ads}(U_{abs})=-|e|U_{abs}+G_{Na*}-G_{*}-G_{Na^+}\] <p>where solvation is currently neglected. This seems straightforward to calculate as only the free energy of Na*, the bare surface, and the \(Na^+\) in the gas-phase are needed. However, the dilemma of modeling this in a DFT cell is the fact that the simulations are not simulated at the constant and correct potential. This is an artifact of the DFT simulation being constant charge (constant number of electrons) rather than being constant postant. This dilemma is illustrated in the figure below.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ConstantqvsV-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ConstantqvsV-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ConstantqvsV-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ConstantqvsV.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>As seen above, the initial state (the bare metal surface with \(Na^+\) in the gas-phase) is at the potential of zero charge of the bare metal in vacuum (\(U_{pzc,*}\) \(\approx\) 0.5 V-SHE).</p> <p>When we adsorb Na onto the metal, Na donates electrons to the metal. This changes the energy of the electron (fermi energy) and thus, the measured \(U_{pzc,Na*}\) \(\approx\) -0.7 V-SHE.</p> <p>This is an issue as 1) the two states of interest are not compared at the same potentials (not apples-to-apples) and 2) they are not necessarily the potential of interest. This is purely an artifact of the DFT simulation being a canonical simulation.</p> <p>In real life in an actual electrochemical experiment, the potential of these two states or the metal surface is kept at a constant potential by varying the number of electrons. The potentiostat is the tool that essentially injects/removes electrons on the surface to maintain a specific potential. Here, the DFT simulation needs a “computational potentiostat” to correct the simulation to a specific potential as shown in Figure b, essentially modeling a Grand Canonical simulations.</p> <h1 id="grand-canonical-density-functional-theory">Grand Canonical Density Functional Theory</h1> <p>The dilemma is defined but what are the solutions to convert a Canonical DFT simulation to an Grand Canonical simulation? Here, I discuss two ways to understandThen, we briefly discuss the fundamentals and a brief introduction of Grand Canonical DFT methods.</p> <h2 id="the-fundamentals-of-corrections-to-constant-potential">The Fundamentals of Corrections to Constant Potential</h2> <h3 id="electrostatic-explanation">Electrostatic Explanation</h3> <p>A given reaction state,\(\lambda\), can be given in a generalized form and assigned at a potential of zero charge, \(U_{pzc,\lambda}\). This is seen above where the potential of the bare metal surface is \(U_{pzc,*}\) \(\approx\) 0.5 V-SHE and the potential of the Na* is \(U_{pzc,*}\) \(\approx\) -0.7 V-SHE, where \(\lambda\) is respectively * and Na*.</p> <p>Here, we can generally write the corrected Grand Canonical energy of a reaction state, \(\Omega_{\lambda}(U)\), as:</p> \[\Omega_{\lambda}(U) =G_{\lambda}(U) = G_{\lambda}(U_{pzc,\lambda})+E_{charging}\] <p>where \(G_{\lambda}(U_{pzc,\lambda})\) is the free energy of reaction state from the “default” Canonical DFT simulation and \(E_{charging}\) is the energy to charge the reaction state to the correct potential, \(U\). From electrostatics, \(E_{charging}\) is the defined in the general form as:</p> \[E_{charging} = -\int_{q=0}^{q(U)}\frac{q}{C}dq=-\int_{q=0}^{q(U)}Udq\] <p>where \(q\) is the charge and \(C\) is the capacitance. This can be written with the previous equation as:</p> \[\Omega_{\lambda}(U) = G_{\lambda}(U_{pzc,\lambda})-\int_{q=0}^{q(U)}Udq\] <p>where if we knew how the potential difference (voltage) changes as we charge the reaction state, we can correctly charge the reaction state of interest from \(U_{pzc,\lambda}\) to \(U\).</p> <h3 id="thermodynamic-explanation">Thermodynamic Explanation</h3> <p>We cheated a bit before by assuming the energy of the canonical simulation is the Gibbs Free energy. In short, we basically assumed the Helmholtz Free energy and the Gibbs Free energy to be similar because we assume the internal energy,\(E\), and enthalpy,\(H\), are equivalent: \(H=E+PV\) where the constant pressure is assumed.</p> <p>Here, we will use a more thermodynamically correct term of the Helmholtz Free Energy to represent the thermodynamic potential energy of a canonical simulation which is defined as: \(F = E - TS\) where \(E\) is the internal energy, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(S\) is the entropy. The Helmholtz free energy is the thermodynamic potential of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium from which all \(T\) and volume,\(V\) ,are constant. More importantly, the number of electrons or \(N\) are constant.</p> <p>A Grand Canonical simulation is a system at thermodynamic equilibrium where T and \(V\) are constant but the chemical potential of the electrons,\(\mu\), is now constant (or N is non-constant). The Grand Canonical Free energy is given by the general Legendre Transform as:</p> \[\Omega(y) = F(x)-xy\] <p>where for our case it is defined as:</p> <p>\(\Omega(\mu) = F(N)-\mu N\) w Here, we converted the Canonical energy to a Grand Canonical energy by performing a legendre transform. The chemical potential represents the change in energy to add or subtract number of electrons. The last term represents the energy to gain or lose electrons as the number of electrons are changed. Once again, if we knew how the chemical potential of the electron changes as we change the number of electrons, we know how to calculate the Grand Canonical Energy.</p> <p>If we take the equation we derived previously based on electrostatics, we can write the following expression that looks quite similar as:</p> \[\Omega(\mu) = F(N)-\mu N \approx G_{\lambda}(U_{pzc,\lambda})-\int_{q=0}^{q(U)}Udq\] <p>where here is the relationship between electrostatics and thermodynamics again if we (confusingly) assume \(F(N)\approx G_{\lambda}(U_{pzc,\lambda})\). Hopefully, this alternative explanation has some help in understanding how we can obtain Grand Canonical Free Energies. FYI, the negative term indicates the adding electrons decreases the energy of the system.</p> <h1 id="explicit-vs-analytical-potentiostats">Explicit vs Analytical Potentiostats</h1> <p>From the derivations, the dilemma remains that we need an approximation of how the approximate the energy to charge a reaction state to a specific potential either from \(-\int_{q=0}^{q(U)}Udq\) or \(-\mu N\). These forms are generally unknown and there are two ways to approximate these terms.</p> <p>First is to explicitly model a potentiostat to approximate the energy to charge the system. I will not go too in depth and further readings are at the end. In a nutshell, there simulation methods that essentially inject or remove electrons in the DFT simulation to correct to the \(U\) defined. If you know how many electrons you added or remove, you know \(N\) and you can approximate \(\mu\) by your description of how the energy cost of adding electrons in vacuum or in a media in the DFT cell that represents the electrolyte. Thus, you can explicitly model DFT simulations at different potentials without the simulation failing or crashing. The disadvantage of these methods are its computational cost and the approximation of the electrolyte that is ill-defined experimentally, which dictations \(\mu\) and \(N\) essentially.</p> <p>The second way is the analytically determine the charging energy. If we assume a potential-independent capacitance, we can derive the energy to charge our DFT reaction state as:</p> \[E_{charging} = -\int_{q=0}^{q(U)}\frac{q}{C}dq=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{q^2}{C}=-\frac{1}{2}C(U-U_{pzc,\lambda})^2\] <p>where now the energy to charge a DFT reaction state to a specific potential based on a potential-independent capacitance is:</p> \[\Omega_{\lambda}(U) = G_{\lambda}(U_{pzc,\lambda})-\frac{1}{2}C(U-U_{pzc,\lambda})^2\] <p>Here, we can calculate the “correct” Grand Canonical potential of any state if we knew the capacitance. This can be estimated experimentally or from simulations. If you wanted to use an expression of a potential-dependent capacitance, you just have to rederive the integral. The advantage of this approach is that you can analytically (without coding into a Fortran VASP simulation) evaluate the Grand Canonical DFT energy. Of course, careful treatment must be considered as this assume that the reaction state at \(U_{pzc,\lambda}\) remains unperturbed at \(U\), which may not be true.</p> <h1 id="outlook-and-further-readings">Outlook and Further Readings</h1> <p>Here we overviewed the dilemma of “default” DFT simulations to model Grand Canonical or Constant potential simulations. We derived both the theory to calculate Grand Canonical DFT simulations and introduced approaches that addresses these dilemmas.</p> <p>For further readings, consider the following:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/157/18/180902/2842002/Electrochemistry-from-the-atomic-scale-in-the">This paper has great derivations of what I discussed and explicit DFT approaches.</a></li> <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202300950">This work also compares between different Grand Canonical DFT approaches</a></li> <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2024.115360">This is our Analytical DFT paper</a></li> <li><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00836">This paper compares explicit and analytical Grand Canonical DFT approaches</a>):</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="GC-DFT"/><category term="GC-DFT"/><category term="DFT"/><category term="basics"/><category term="electrocatalysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Default DFT simulations are inherently Canonical simulations.

The acid dissociation constant, Ka, is crucial in understanding the form of the anion upon adsorption at the surface. The strength of the acid is based on the equilibrium constant of acid dissociation given as:</p> \[HA_{(aq)} \leftrightarrow A^-_{(aq)} + H^+_{(aq)}\] <p>where \(A^-\) is the conjugate base of the acid and \(H^+\) is the proton in solution. All species are in the solution-phase for clarity. The equilibrium constant, \(K_a\), is defined as:</p> \[K_a = \frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]}\] <p>where a higher Ka corresponds to a stronger acid (more dissociated at equilibrium). Assuming concentrations are sufficient for an ideal solution (activities are equivalent to the concentrations), the pKa is defined as:</p> \[pK_a = -log_{10}K_a\] <p>where this convenient scale defines lower pK\(_a\) as stronger acids (larger Ka).</p> <h2 id="ideality-and-activities">Ideality and Activities</h2> <p>Note that ideality was assumed, where concentrations are sufficient [X]. In a solution with varying ionic strengths, temperatures, compositions, and pressures, this is assumption is not always true. The Figure below shows a case of acetic acid is dependent on the ionic strength, where ideality deviates with stronger ionic solutions.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PK_acetic_acid-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/PK_acetic_acid-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/PK_acetic_acid-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/PK_acetic_acid.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The activity is a measure of the “effective concentration” or “real concentration”. In the simplest form, the activity of any species at equilibrium is defined as:</p> \[\{X\}=[X]\gamma_X\] <p>where the general form of the activity of any species is given as {X}. The activity coefficient,\(\gamma\), measures the ideality of species X. An activity coefficient of one indicates complete ideality.</p> <p>Ka can be corrected by using the activity coefficients of each species can be corrected to account for the non-ideality of the solution as follows:</p> \[K^\Theta = K_a\Gamma = K_a\frac{\gamma_A^- \gamma_H^+}{\gamma_{HA}}=\frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]}\frac{\gamma_A^- \gamma_H^+}{\gamma_{HA}}\] <p>where \(\Gamma\) is the activity quotient for the reaction. Henry’s and Raoult’s law are used to provide a estimates of the activity coefficient.</p> <h2 id="proton-affinity">Proton Affinity</h2> <p>Note that Ka requires the knowledge of the enthalpic, entropic, and solvation contributions during the dissociation of an acid. A simple metric based on purely the enthalpic components is the proton affinity defined as:</p> \[HA_{(g)} \rightarrow A^-_{(g)} + H^+_{(g)}\] <p>where all species are in the gas-phase rather than bulk solution. This is proton affinity is also known as gas-phase basicity. The proton affinity (a positive value) measures the intrinsic property of a molecule given as:</p> \[E_{PA}=E_{A^-_{(g)}} + E_{H^+_{(g)}} - E_{HA_{(g)}}\] <p>where larger proton affinities, (More stable HA and less stable \(A^-\) ) means stronger base or weaker acid. Note that the energies of each species are not written as free energies.</p> <h1 id="equilibrium-potentials-of-anion-specific-adsorption">Equilibrium Potentials of Anion Specific Adsorption</h1> <p>Specific adsorption of anions are dependent on the pH of the solution. We derive the equilibrium adsorption potential for both high and low pH solutions relative to the pKa of the anion of interest.</p> <h2 id="high-ph-case">High pH Case</h2> <p>When the pH is higher than the pKa, HA has dissociated into \(A^-\). Anions specifically adsorb on a metal surface describe by the following reaction:</p> \[A^-_{(aq)}+ * \rightarrow A^*_{(aq)} + e^-\] <p>where the aqueous anion undergoes electron transfer upon adsorption and (partially) desolvates. The potential-dependent free energy change of this reaction is written as the form as:</p> \[\Delta G_{ads}(U_{abs})=G_{A^*_{(aq)}} + G_{e^-} - G_{A^-_{(aq)}} - G_{*_{(aq)}}\] <p>The free energy change of the adsorbed anion, \(A^*\) is generally defined as:</p> \[G_{i_{(g)}} = E_{i,DFT} + E_{ZPVE} + TS_{vib}\] <p>where the DFT Enthalpy at 0 K is \(E_i\), the zero point energy is \(E_{ZPVE}\) , and \(TS_{vib}\) is the entropic corrections. At a first approximation, the latter two terms are determined from DFT from both a harmonic oscillator approximation and vibrational calculations.</p> <p>Approximating the solvation free energy change during specific adsorption is challenging. Here, we define the solvation free energy change for specific anion adsorption as:</p> \[\Delta\Delta G_{solv} = \Delta G_{solv,A*} -\Delta G_{solv,*} - \Delta G_{solv,A^-}\] <p>where the solvation energy of each species is generally defined as:</p> \[\Delta G_{solv,i} = G_{i_{(aq)}}-G_{i_{(g)}}\] <p>The solvation energy of \(A^-\) in theory should be potential-independent as it is in the bulk solution far away from the electrode. The solvation energy of \(A^*\) and the bare metal can be potential-dependent and are ill-defined. Here, we assume these solvation contributions are potential-independent to rewrite the free energy change of specific anion adsorption as:</p> \[\Delta G_{ads}(U_{abs})=G_{A^*_{(g)}} + G_{e^-} - G_{A^-_{(g)}} - G_{*_{(g)}}+\Delta\Delta G_{solv}\] <p>Note that the free energy of the electron is simply defined as: \(G_{e^-}=-|e|U_{abs}\) where e is the electron charge and the \(U_{abs}\) is the electrode on the absolute potential. The equilibrium potential, \(U^0\) is insightful in predicting the potential at which anions would adsorb. This occurs when the free energy change of adsorption is at zero defined as:</p> \[\Delta G_{ads}(U^0_{abs})=0=G_{A^*_{(g)}} -|e|U^0_{abs} - G_{A^-_{(g)}} - G_{*_{(g)}}+\Delta\Delta G_{solv}\] \[U^0_{abs}=\frac{G_{A^*_{(g)}} - G_{A^-_{(g)}} - G_{*_{(g)}}+\Delta\Delta G_{solv}}{|e|}\] <p>where \(U^0_{abs}\) is the equilibrium potential on the absolute scale. Experimental electrochemical measurements are not relative the absolute scale (electron in vacuum) but, for example, to the standard hydrogen electrode. The equilibrium potential on an absolute scale can simply be converted to a relevant potential by defining:</p> \[U^0_{SHE} = U^0_{abs} + \Delta U_{abs \rightarrow SHE}\] \[U^0_{SHE} =\frac{G_{A^*_{(g)}} - G_{A^-_{(g)}} - G_{*_{(g)}}+\Delta\Delta G_{solv}}{|e|} + \Delta U_{abs \rightarrow SHE}\] <p>where the conversion from U-abs to U-SHE ranges from -4.2 to 5.0 V-SHE. Finally, we have derived the equilibrium adsorption potential on an SHE from DFT for the case of high pH.</p> <h2 id="low-ph-case">Low pH Case</h2> <p>When the pH is lower than the pKa, HA is more stable in solution. Specific adsorption of the anion occurs simultaneous deprotonation and electron transfer onto a metal surface defined as:</p> \[HA_{(aq)}+ * \rightarrow A^*_{(aq)} + e^- + H^+\] <p>where the aqueous anion undergoes electron transfer upon adsorption and (partially) desolvates. The free energy change of this reaction is written as the form as:</p> \[\Delta G_{ads}(U_{abs})=G_{A^*_{(aq)}} + G_{e^-} + G_{H^+}- G_{HA_{(aq)}} - G_{*}\] \[\Delta G_{ads}(U_{abs})=G_{A^*_{(aq)}} -|e|U_{abs} + G_{H^+}- G_{HA_{(aq)}} - G_{*}\] <p>Less derivations will be shown but it is important to define the free energy of the proton. We will discuss two methods: 1) defining the energy of the proton in bulk solution and 2) the computational Hydrogen electrode.</p> <h3 id="defining-the-protons-gibbs-free-energy-she">Defining the Proton’s Gibbs Free Energy (SHE):</h3> <p>In it’s simplest form for pH-independence, the free energy of the proton in bulk solution is defined as: \(G_{H^+_{(aq)}} = G_{H^+_{(g)}} + \Delta G_{H^+,solv}\)</p> <p>This value carries uncertainty as it is highly dependent on the free energy of the proton, which is challenging to quantify experimentally and requires thermodynamic assumptions. Regardless, the equilibrium adsorption potential on an SHE scale can be calculated as</p> \[\Delta G_{ads}(U^0_{abs})= 0=G_{A^*_{(aq)}} -|e|U^0_{abs} + G_{H^+}- G_{HA_{(aq)}} - G_{*}\] \[U^0_{abs}=\frac{G_{A^*_{(aq)}} + G_{H^+}- G_{HA_{(aq)}} - G_{*}}{|e|}\] <p>which \(U^0\) can be converted to the SHE scale as defined previously.</p> <h3 id="the-computational-hydrogen-electrode-rhe">The Computational Hydrogen Electrode (RHE)</h3> <p>An alternative method to determining the free energy of the proton in bulk solution is to use the Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) Approach, which uses the well-defined reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This defines the free energy or chemical potential of both the proton in bulk solution and electron as:</p> \[\mu_{H^+} +\mu_{e^+} = \frac{1}{2}G_{H_2,(g)} - |e|U_{RHE}\] <p>where it utilizes the fact that protons and electrons are at equilibrium with \(H_2\) gas at 0 V-RHE. The latter term accounts for the linear deviation from this 0 V-RHE.</p> <p>We can determine the equilibrium adsorption potential using the CHE approach as follows:</p> \[\Delta G_{ads}(U^0_{RHE})= 0=G_{A^*_{(aq)}} + \frac{1}{2}G_{H_2,(g)} - |e|U_{RHE}- G_{HA_{(aq)}} - G_{*}\] \[U^0_{RHE}=\frac{G_{A^*_{(aq)}} + \frac{1}{2}G_{H_2,(g)}- G_{HA_{(aq)}} - G_{*}}{|e|}\] <p>where the equilibrium adsorption potential is determined on a RHE scale. The RHE depends on the pH so conversion back to SHE is possible using the Nernst Equation:</p> \[U^0_{RHE} = U^0_{SHE} - 0.059pH\] \[U^0_{SHE} = U^0_{RHE} + 0.059pH\] <p>Now the low-pH (pH dependent) and the high pH (non-pH dependent) cases of anion adsorption can be calculated.</p> <h2 id="python-script-visualizing-anion-adsorption-using-the-equilibrium-adsorption-potential">Python Script: Visualizing Anion Adsorption using the Equilibrium Adsorption Potential</h2> <p>I have created a Google Colab link you can check out to play with a simple script to visualize anion adsorption regimes and how the equilibrium adsorption potenital relates.</p> <p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17M9gAGZCiIyxxdshJ-f6leRZQpKLwpFI?usp=sharing">The GoogleColab Notebook can be accessed here.</a></p> <h2 id="considerations-of-the-electrochemical-double-layer-and-constant-potential">Considerations of the Electrochemical Double Layer and Constant Potential</h2> <p>Here, the simulations are performed at constant charge (fixed number of electrons), where in experimental set ups are performed at constant potential (varying number of electrons).
