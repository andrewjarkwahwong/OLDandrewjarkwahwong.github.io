It still feels surreal that I passed my doctoral defense! Thank you to Mike, my committee (Prof. Ismaila Dabo, Prof. Rob Rioux, and Prof. Ray Schaak), and my friends/families for taking time to hear about my work.

The title of my disseration was "Electrocatalysis at the atomic scale: complextities at the electrode-electrolyte interface".

Once it is published, I will post a link to my thesis here if anyone is interested to read a 700+ page collection of my work or at least the abstract.

Two quotes resonated with me throughout my Ph.D.
> "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."
> —Isaac Newton
The completion of my Ph.D. is not possible without the brilliant academics and labmates that helped along the way. I feel my Ph.D. is unique in that I had the opportunity to work with so many teams of different backgrounds, providing me unique perspectives and great personalities to work with during my Ph.D.

Outside of my academic circle, my girlfriend, friends, family, and my cat has been supportive network that has supported me through my Ph.D. and life. 

The last quote always pushed me to work as hard as I can and stay motivated.
